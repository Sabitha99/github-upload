Let’s start with the definition. Although the name in itself is pretty self-explanatory, 
a fingerprint door lock may be defined as “a system which grants access to authorized personnel
 by virtue of recognizing their unique fingerprints.”You have probably looked at your hands countless
 times and noticed the ridges and valley pattern. The patterns were an important outcome of the human 
evolution as they enhanced our ability to grip. However, an unforeseen consequence of this particular
 step in the evolutionary process was to grant humans a fantastic method of identification.
